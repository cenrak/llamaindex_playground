One of the essential goals of \\nVision 2030 is the continued transformation towards digitalization and the improvement \\nof its infrastructure in order to keep up with the accelerated global progress in digital \\nservices, renewable global networks, IT/ OT systems and artificial intelligence and 4th \\nindustrial revolution transformations. \\nThis transformation requires supporting the ease of information flow, securing that \\ninformation and preserving the integrity of all systems. It also requires maintaining \\nand supporting the cybersecurity of the Kingdom in order to protect its vital interests, \\nnational security, critical infrastructures, high priority sectors and governmental services \\nand practices. To accomplish this objective, the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) \\nwas established, and its mandate was approved as per the Royal Decree number 6801, \\ndated 11/2/1439H making it the national and specialized reference for matters related to \\ncybersecurity in the Kingdom. \\nNCA ’s mandate and duties fulfill the strategic and regulatory cybersecurity needs related \\nto the development and issuance of cybersecurity national policies, governance mechanisms, \\nframeworks, standards, controls and guidelines. \\nNCA ’s mandate also fulfill the need to continuously monitor the organizations' compliance \\nas the importance of cybersecurity has significantly increased more than ever with the rise of \\nsecurity risks in the cyberspace.  \\nNCA ’s mandate states that its responsibility for cybersecurity does not absolve any \\ngovernment or private organization from its own cybersecurity responsibilities as confirmed \\nby the Royal Decree number 57231, dated 10/11/1439H, which states that “all government \\norganizations must improve their cybersecurity level to protect their networks, systems and \\ndata, and comply with NCA ’s policies, frameworks, standards, controls and guidelines” and \\nwhat the Royal Decree number 7732, dated 12/2/1440H has also confirmed.\\nFrom this perspective, NCA developed the Critical Systems Cybersecurity Controls \\n(CSCC - 1 : 2019) to set the minimum cybersecurity requirements for critical systems in \\nall organizations, in addition to the Essential Cybersecurity Controls (ECC - 1 : 2018).

Having two strength levels provides more flexibility to choose \\nthe appropriate level of protection for different classes of data, systems and networks. \\nEach national entity is required to choose and implement the appropriate cryptographic \\nstandard level based on the nature and sensitivity of the data, systems and networks to be \\nprotected. Furthermore, other cybersecurity regulations, issued by the NCA, may mandate \\nthe use of a particular cryptographic standard level to protect data, systems and networks.\\nThe MODERATE and ADVANCED strength levels are designed to target 128-bit and 256-bit \\nsecurity levels, respectively.

Attacks can be carried out \\nby remote and passive adversaries which are difficult to be detected and may lead to a \\nsignificant and unnoticed leakage of data.\\nIn order to prevent these attacks, the first step to minimize information leakage is to \\nensure that for the side channel signals, the signal-to-noise ratio is as low as possible. \\nFurther, it must also be ensured that the information leakages from side-channels are not \\nuseful for the adversaries 18. For example, eliminate any correlation between the binary \\nrepresentation of secret key and side channel signals, i.e. use dummy operations to mask \\nany potential correlation.\\nIn order to minimize the risk of side-channel attacks, it is important to satisfy the following \\nrequirements19:\\n• Cryptographic operations must be performed in certified hardware components, e.g.\\n  smart cards to protect the secret and/or private keys.\\n• Analyse thoroughly the effects of such side channels on certified hardware components in \\n  a specialized laboratory during the development process.\\n• Protect ciphertexts using MAC and verify ciphertexts before performing any other cryptographic\\n  operations.\\nSide-channel attacks cover a wide range of threat scenarios.
