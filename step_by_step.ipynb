One of the essential goals of \\nVision 2030 is the continued transformation towards digitalization and the improvement \\nof its infrastructure in order to keep up with the accelerated global progress in digital \\nservices, renewable global networks, IT/ OT systems and artificial intelligence and 4th \\nindustrial revolution transformations. \\nThis transformation requires supporting the ease of information flow, securing that \\ninformation and preserving the integrity of all systems. It also requires maintaining \\nand supporting the cybersecurity of the Kingdom in order to protect its vital interests, \\nnational security, critical infrastructures, high priority sectors and governmental services \\nand practices. To accomplish this objective, the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) \\nwas established, and its mandate was approved as per the Royal Decree number 6801, \\ndated 11/2/1439H making it the national and specialized reference for matters related to \\ncybersecurity in the Kingdom. \\nNCA ’s mandate and duties fulfill the strategic and regulatory cybersecurity needs related \\nto the development and issuance of cybersecurity national policies, governance mechanisms, \\nframeworks, standards, controls and guidelines. \\nNCA ’s mandate also fulfill the need to continuously monitor the organizations' compliance \\nas the importance of cybersecurity has significantly increased more than ever with the rise of \\nsecurity risks in the cyberspace.  \\nNCA ’s mandate states that its responsibility for cybersecurity does not absolve any \\ngovernment or private organization from its own cybersecurity responsibilities as confirmed \\nby the Royal Decree number 57231, dated 10/11/1439H, which states that “all government \\norganizations must improve their cybersecurity level to protect their networks, systems and \\ndata, and comply with NCA ’s policies, frameworks, standards, controls and guidelines” and \\nwhat the Royal Decree number 7732, dated 12/2/1440H has also confirmed.\\nFrom this perspective, NCA developed the Critical Systems Cybersecurity Controls \\n(CSCC - 1 : 2019) to set the minimum cybersecurity requirements for critical systems in \\nall organizations, in addition to the Essential Cybersecurity Controls (ECC - 1 : 2018).

One of the essential goals of \\nVision 2030 is the continued transformation towards digitalization and the improvement \\nof its infrastructure in order to keep up with the accelerated global progress in digital \\nservices, renewable global networks, IT/ OT systems and artificial intelligence and 4th \\nindustrial revolution transformations. \\nThis transformation requires supporting the ease of information flow, securing that \\ninformation and preserving the integrity of all systems. It also requires maintaining \\nand supporting the cybersecurity of the Kingdom in order to protect its vital interests, \\nnational security, critical infrastructures, high priority sectors and governmental services \\nand practices. To accomplish this objective, the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) \\nwas established, and its mandate was approved as per the Royal Decree number 6801, \\ndated 11/2/1439H making it the national and specialized reference for matters related to \\ncybersecurity in the Kingdom. \\nNCA ’s mandate and duties fulfill the strategic and regulatory cybersecurity needs related \\nto the development and issuance of cybersecurity national policies, governance mechanisms, \\nframeworks, standards, controls and guidelines. \\nNCA ’s mandate also fulfill the need to continuously monitor the organizations\\' compliance \\nas the importance of cybersecurity has significantly increased more than ever with the rise of \\nsecurity risks in the cyberspace.  \\nNCA ’s mandate states that its responsibility for cybersecurity does not absolve any \\ngovernment or private organization from its own cybersecurity responsibilities as confirmed \\nby the Royal Decree number 57231, dated 10/11/1439H, which states that “all government \\norganizations must improve their cybersecurity level to protect their networks, systems and \\ndata, and comply with NCA ’s policies, frameworks, standards, controls and guidelines” and \\nwhat the Royal Decree number 7732, dated 12/2/1440H has also confirmed.\\nFrom this perspective, NCA developed the Critical Systems Cybersecurity Controls \\n(CSCC - 1 : 2019) to set the minimum cybersecurity requirements for critical systems in \\nall organizations, in addition to the Essential Cybersecurity Controls (ECC - 1 : 2018). This \\ndocument highlights the details of CSCC controls, goals, scope, statement of applicability, \\ncompliance and monitoring. 11\\n:  WhiteAll organizations that own or operate critical systems must implement all necessary \\nmeasures to ensure continuous compliance with the CSCC as per item 3 of article 10 of \\nNCA ’s mandate and as per the Royal Decree number 57231, dated 10/11/1439H, also as per \\nthe Royal Decree number 7732, dated 12/2/1440H.12\\n:  WhiteIntroduction\\nThe National Cybersecurity Authority (referred to in this document as \"NCA\") \\ndeveloped the Essential Cybersecurity Controls (ECC - 1 : 2018) to set the minimum \\ncybersecurity requirements for organizations. As an extension and a complement  to ECC, \\nthe Critical Systems Cybersecurity Controls (CSCC - 1 : 2019) was developed to fit the \\ncybersecurity needs for national critical systems. \\nThe CSCC was developed after conducting a comprehensive study of multiple national \\nand international cybersecurity frameworks and standards, studying related national \\ndecisions, law and regulatory requirements, reviewing and leveraging cybersecurity best \\npractices, analyzing previous cybersecurity incidents and attacks on government and other \\ncritical organizations, and conducting public consultations. \\nDuring the development of these controls, NCA considered the alignment between \\nCSCC and ECC (which is a prerequisite for compliance with CSCC). The organizations \\nmust continuously comply with ECC in order to be fully compliant with the CSCC. for \\nthat, the CSCC consists of the following:\\n• 4 Main Domains \\n• 21 Subdomains \\n• 32 Main Controls \\n• 73 Subcontrols13\\n:  WhiteObjectives\\nAs an extension to ECC, the CSCC aims to enable organizations and build their protection \\nand cyber resilience capabilities against cyber attacks, and sustain information technology \\nassets for critical systems. The CSCC was developed based on international standards and best \\npractices in order to meet the current security needs and raise organizations\\' preparedness to \\nface the growing cybersecurity risks against their critical systems that may result in negative \\nimpacts and significant losses on the national level. 14\\n:  WhiteDefinition and Identification Criteria of Critical Systems \\nCritical Systems Definition\\nAny system or network whose failure, unauthorized change to its operation, unauthorized \\naccess to it, or to the data stored or processed by it; may result in negative impact on the \\norganization’s businesses and services’ availability, or cause negative economic, financial, \\nsecurity or social impacts on the national level.\\nCritical Systems Identification Criteria \\nThe following are the criteria that may be used by organizations to identify critical systems \\nthey own:\\n1. Negative impact on national security.\\n2. Negative impact on the Kingdom’s reputation and public image.\\n3. Significant financial losses (i.e., more than 0.01% of GDP). \\n4. Negative impact on the services provided to a large number of users (i.e., more \\n        than 5% of the population) \\n5. Loss of lives. \\n6. Unauthorized disclosure of data that is classified as Top Secret or Secret. \\n7. Negative impact on the operations of one (or more) vital sector(s). 15\\n:  WhiteComponents of Critical Systems\\nBelow is the list of critical systems\\' components (1 through 8 are the technical components):\\n1.

Negative impact on national security.\\n2. Negative impact on the Kingdom’s reputation and public image.\\n3. Significant financial losses (i.e., more than 0.01% of GDP). \\n4. Negative impact on the services provided to a large number of users (i.e., more \\n        than 5% of the population) \\n5. Loss of lives. \\n6. Unauthorized disclosure of data that is classified as Top Secret or Secret. \\n7. Negative impact on the operations of one (or more) vital sector(s). 15\\nDocument Classification: OpenCritical Systems Cybersecurity Controls Sharing Indicator:  WhiteComponents of Critical Systems\\nBelow is the list of critical systems' components (1 through 8 are the technical components):\\n1. Network, for example:\\n1.1. Connecting devices, such as:\\n• Router.\\n• Switches.\\n• Gateways. \\n1.2 Firewall. \\n1.3 Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). \\n1.4 Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) protection devices. \\n2. Databases. \\n3. Storage Assets. \\n4. Middleware. \\n5. Servers and Operating Systems. \\n6. Applications. \\n7. Encryption Devices. \\n8. Critical systems’ peripherals, (e.g., printers and scanners).\\n9. Individuals working in critical systems’ supporting roles (e.g., users, technical staff \\n          with significant and sensitive privileges, operators and service providers).\\n10. Documents related to the components above.16\\nDocument Classification: OpenCritical Systems Cybersecurity Controls Sharing Indicator:  WhiteScope of Work and Applicability\\nCSCC Scope of Work \\nThese controls are applicable to systems deemed critical (as per the criteria forementioned \\nin this document) by the organizations who own or operate these systems, whether they \\nare government organizations in the kingdom or abroad (e.g., ministries, authorities, \\nestablishments, embassies and others), subsidiaries of government or private organizations, \\nwhich are all referred to herein as “Organization” . \\nCSCC Statement of Applicability \\nEvery organization must comply with all applicable controls after assessing the extent of \\nimpact and conducting necessary checks before implementation. Some controls' applicability \\ndiffers from one organization to another, for example:\\n• Controls in Subdomain 4-2 (Cloud Computing and Hosting Cybersecurity) are \\napplicable and must be implemented by organizations currently using or planning to use \\ncloud computing and hosting services. 17\\nDocument Classification: OpenCritical Systems Cybersecurity Controls Sharing Indicator:  WhiteImplementation and Compliance\\nIn order to comply with item 3 of article 10 of NCA ’s mandate, and as per the Royal \\nDecree number 57231, dated 10/11/1439H, and the Royal Decree number 7732, dated \\n12/2/1440H, all organizations within the scope of the CSCC must:\\n1. Identify the organization's critical systems using (Critical Systems Identification \\n     Criteria).\\n2. Implement all necessary measures to comply with these controls on the identified \\n  critical systems within the compliance period defined by NCA, provided that \\n   cybersecurity risks are assessed and managed to minimize potential risks during \\n    the defined compliance period. \\n3. Ensure the continuous compliance after the defined compliance period.\\nNCA evaluates the organizations' compliance with the CSCC through multiple means \\nsuch as self-assessments by the organizations themselves, and/or on-site audits, in \\naccordance with the mechanisms deemed appropriate by the NCA.\\nUpdate and Review\\nNCA will periodically review and update the CSCC as per the related industry cybersecurity \\nupdates.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=7453, end_char_idx=11976, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), score=0.4958496987854468)], metadata={'02caf26c-a3d7-48fa-93b3-2a8d119313b8': {'source': 'saudi2030.pdf', 'Title': 'Saudi Vision 2030'}, 'b49c218d-cd9f-4c34-8910-3613e0d630ee': {'source': 'saudi2030.pdf', 'Title': 'Saudi Vision 2030'}})"
